# What is the result of the last line 
# in the code below?

greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting # => "hi there"
puts greetings

# The output is {:a=> "hi there"}.  The reason
# is because informal_greeting is a reference
# to the original object.  The line 
# informal_greting << ' there' was using the 
# String#<< method, which modifies the object that
# called it.  This means that the original 
# object was changed, thereby impacting the value
# in greetings.  If instead of modifying the
# original object, we wanted to only modify
# informal_greeting but not greetings,
# there are a couple of options:

# - We couold initialize informal_greeting with
#   a reference to a new object containing
#   the same value by 
#   informal_greeting = greetings[:a].clone .
# - We can use string concatenation,
#   informal_greeting = informail_greeting + ' there',
#   which returns a new Stringobject instead
#   of modifying the original object.
